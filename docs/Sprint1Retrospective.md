**Individual Sprint 1 Retrospective**

### What Went Wrong:
- I didn't allocate enough for time for project planning, meaning that my initial features and requirements were poor
- I also delayed working on the project in favor of other pursuits, mainly my capstone project
---
### What Went Well:
- Learning React. It's a very smooth transition from knowing Flutter/Dart and Javascript.
- I progressed very quickly with the allotted time I gave myself
---
### Analysis & Improvement Plan:
- Work on a consistent, weekly basis
- Don't procrastinate
- Another round of project planning for Sprint 2

---

## Weekly Summary

- Week 2: Blank
- Week 3: Did HW3 (Learning React)
- Week 4: Made Basic Frontend and Backend that allows client to send messages, create and select conversations, and get messages from the server (Will Later be ChatGPT)
